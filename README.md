## Introduction
This repository contains documentation for the ParkMobile App Improvement Project, conducted by Andrew Alikakos, Conor Monahan, Pengfei Lu, Sindu Thoompally, and myself. In this project, we focused on enhancing the user experience and efficiency of the ParkMobile app by introducing a new parking zone registration system.

## Section I: Industry, Market, and Business Model
- **Industry**: ParkMobile operates in the smart parking systems industry, with a global market estimated at $6.49 billion in 2022.
- **Market**: The company generates revenue through transaction fees and offers services in approximately 400 U.S. cities.
- **Business Model**: ParkMobile's mission is to simplify urban parking and make cities more livable, targeting high-traffic areas and college campuses for expansion.

## Section II: Opportunities and Problems
- The project aims to address issues such as user confusion, delayed parking, and inaccurate spot selection.
- Introducing parking zones with advanced GPS technology will streamline the parking process, reducing user stress and errors.

## Section III: Proposed New Process
- The new system simplifies registration by allowing users to select parking zones instead of specific spot numbers.
- It requires front-end and back-end adjustments, including user data consent for location tracking.
- Additional features include license plate recognition to expedite registration.

## Section IV: System Architecture and User Research
- The ParkMobile app follows a client-server architecture.
- User interviews and research helped identify pain points, such as difficulty selecting individual parking spots.

## Section V: UI Prototype, Site Map, and Acquisition Strategy
- The UI prototype showcases a user-friendly design with zone-based parking, extended reservation options, and license plate input.
- A site map outlines the app's hierarchy and content.
- We recommend building the system in-house through an RFP acquisition process.

## Analysis of System Changes
- The project's key change is constant pinpoint geographic location tracking, reducing the need for specific spot selection.
- It offers benefits like faster parking, improved accuracy, and enhanced user satisfaction.
- Potential risks include privacy concerns, which we mitigate through data protection measures and clear user communication.

## Cost / Benefit Analysis
- NPV analysis estimates a positive return on investment, supporting the project's viability.

## Potential Risks and Mitigation Strategies
- Identified risks include user confusion, inaccurate data, technical issues, and privacy concerns.
- Mitigation strategies involve extensive user testing, data verification, rigorous testing, data privacy measures, and user communication.

In this project we aimed to improve the ParkMobile app's functionality, making parking easier and more efficient for users. The collaborative efforts of our team ensured a comprehensive approach to enhancing the overall user experience.
